## Phase 1

For phase 1, each team is required to connect all necessary components together in a single based station so that:

    a joystick can control the movement of the two servo motors mounted inside a pan-and-tilt kid;
    a joystick can fire the laser ON/OFF with a push-button;
    a light-sensor can detect the presence or absence of a light source;
    an LCD display which shows the state of the light sensor and joystick.

First, construct a block diagram, including power supplies, of how all these components are connected to the ATMega2560 based-station. There may be two types of LCD display available:

    a shield that sits on top of the ATMega2560;  or
    an LCD that connects to the I2C bus.

Choose whichever one that works for you.

For phase 1, you may use sample code that runs on top of the Arduino library. This is to get each team familiar with the hardware quickly. Study the Arduino sample code carefully and make sure that you understand what is required to complete phase 1. It is very important that you understand how the hardware works, i.e., the I/O architecture and GPIO pins of ATMega2560.

Demonstrate your completed phase 1 to your lab instructor before the first milestone, one week before project 1 is due.
